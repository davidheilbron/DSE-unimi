In this small project I tried to replicate the results of:
Moszoro, Mariano and Mauricio Soto, 2022, “Road Quality and Mean Speed Score,” IMF Working Papers 2022/095 (Washington: International Monetary Fund).
The scope was a bit different, as I focused only in Italy instead of producing a country-wise comparison.
I selected the first 100 Italian cities by population, got their distances and travelling time (by car) between each other using the Google Maps Distance API.
Results of the measures used in the paper (Mean Speed, Geometric Mean Speed and Adjusted Mean Speed) are graphed in three different maps.
